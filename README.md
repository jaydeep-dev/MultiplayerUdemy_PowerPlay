# MultiplayerUdemy_PowerPlay
A udemy course project where I am making a third person shooter game following tutorial and making sure I only commit working code to the repository. (Hopefully!! pls don't qoute if something break it's unreal afterall...)

It's continuation of the course and the plugin part is also uploaded in my repository <a href="https://github.com/jaydeep-dev/MultiplayerPlugin-UnrealEngine">here</a>.
